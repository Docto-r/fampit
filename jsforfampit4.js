Infant formula is fortified with vitamin D, thus, when an infant is receiving full feeds of infant formula, vitamin D supplementation is not needed. Families who do not wish to provide a supplement directly to their infant should discuss with a healthcare provider the risks and benefits of maternal high dose supplementation options. Even when consuming a varied diet, achieving adequate vitamin D from foods and beverages (natural sources) alone is challenging, suggesting that young children may need to continue taking a vitamin D supplement after age 12 months.

Infants are typically born with body stores of iron adequate for about the first 6 months of life, depending on gestational age, maternal iron status, and timing of umbilical cord clamping. By age 6 months, however, infants require an external source of iron apart from human milk. Caregivers of infants exclusively fed human milk should talk with their pediatric care provider about whether there may be a need for infants supplementation with iron before age 6 months. A complementary food source of iron beginning at about 6 months is particularly important for infants fed human milk because the iron content of human milk is low and maternal iron intake during lactation does not increase its content. In the United States, an estimated 77 percent of infants fed human milk have inadequate iron intake during the second half of infancy, highlighting the importance of introducing iron-rich foods starting at age 6 months. Infants receiving most of their milk feeds as ironfortified infant formula are likely to need less iron from complementary foods beginning at 6 months of age.

95 % CI, 0.83 - 2.76; 6 vs 0 - 3 items: 5.47; 95 % CI, 1.91 - 15.67), again using a model that adjusted for potential confounders, but not a model that adjusted for both confounders and reverse causality.In this latter model, the results remained statistically significant for 6 foods versus 0 to 3 foods.Nwaru et al90 reported that the introduction of 1 to 2 food items at 4 months and 4 or fewer food items at 6 months was associated with sensitization to egg, CM, fish, and wheat.However, this study also may be confounded by reverse causality.In the 15 - year follow - up of the GINI study, Markevych et al91 noted that higher food diversity during the first year of life was not associated with food sensitization(using the serologic FX5 test, which includes sIgE to CM, egg, peanut, soy, cod, wheat). <br> Grimshaw et al measured dietary patterns(rather than diversity) based on prospective food diary data to investigate whether infant feeding patterns(rather than any specific food / food component) impacted food allergy development.In this small, nested case -controlled study of food - allergic(n ¼ 41) and nonefood - allergic(n ¼ 82) children from a UK birth cohort, no such association was noted between the dietary pattern and development of food allergy, though the ongoing dietary pattern(after solid food introduction up to age 1 year) between the 2 groups was significantly different.This ongoing dietary pattern compared healthy versus unhealthy weaning foods, as defined by infant feeding guidelines, and found the “healthy infant diet” (identified as predominantly home - cooked diet during later infancy with high values for fruit, vegetable, fish, and poultry consumption and low values for highly processed adult foods, eg, ready meals, cook -in -sauces, potato - products, and bacon and the use of commercial baby foods more than once a day) was associated with less food allergy(P ¼ .002).Another report from the same cohort showed that a lower “healthy infant pattern” score was associated with increased risk of all food allergy, including both IgE - and noneIgE - mediated food allergy at the age of 2 years.<br> Lastly, a retrospective analysis of infant dietary patterns on the Isle of Wight in the food allergy intolerance research Birth Cohort noted a significant protective association between dietary diversity at both 6 and 9 months of life and lower odds of developing food allergy over the first decade of life.92 Data from this study indicated that for each additional food introduced by 6 months, the odds of developing food allergy over the first 10 years of life reduced by 10.8 %, even after correcting for significant factors.For each additional potentially allergic food introduced by 12 months, there was a significant reduction of 33.2 % in the likelihood of food allergy over the first 10 years of life.Food allergen diversity did not negatively affect overall food diversity, and there was no association between eczema and age of introduction of solids. <br> Diet diversity studies to date have inherent limitations, including the following: (1) diversity is perhaps more important for typically allergenic than for nonallergenic foods, but these studies do not discriminate the 2 aspects; (2) the amount / regularity of exposure once introduced is not captured; (3) diversity among and also within food groups, for example, how many fruits and vegetables, is not described; and(4) diversity versus early potential allergen introduction is not differentiated.As well, there may be cultural differences to account for in the types of foods that may comprise a diverse diet for a particular infant.", "References": `Roduit, Caroline;
